**Rules.**

- Record a missing backend path or a missing governance decision as a **dependency**. Never invent it.
- Record a frame-versus-governance discrepancy. Never resolve it locally.
- Synthetic data only in any captured screenshot.
- One bounded screen checkpoint, or one tightly coupled shared-shell checkpoint, per commit.

Change made on this screen:    features/trainer/returned-reports-queue.tsx:61
                               bg-brand-600 (#ec4899, 3.53:1 on white text — live AA failure)
                               -> bg-brand-700 (#d6357a, 4.517:1 measured — passes AA)
                               hover:bg-brand-500 (#f472b6, 2.65:1 — failing worse than rest)
                               -> hover:bg-brand-800 (#b02a63, 6.255:1 measured — passes AA)
                               This is the same primary-action pair the F1 foundation already
                               uses in components/ui/button.tsx and components/ui/state-panel.tsx.
                               No token VALUE in app/globals.css was changed.
Excluded, deliberately:        components/brand/brand-mark.tsx:46 (logotype — WCAG-exempt, R-B8
                               requires the approved mark unaltered) and
                               features/trainer/trainer-assessment.tsx:212 (progress-bar fill
                               carrying no text). Both verified untouched in the diff.
Browser viewport:              1440 x 1100 (measurement run); browser smoke suites at their own
                               recorded viewports
Before screenshot:             not captured — this checkpoint proposes no visual acceptance and
                               changes no layout; contrast was measured numerically instead
After screenshot:              not captured — see above

Ending commit:                 the commit created by
                               "fix(frontend): use an accessible brand token for white-label
                               actions (WCAG 2.2 AA)"
Acceptance status:             Not started (unchanged) — F-01a claims no screen visually accepted
Recorded, not fixed:           text-brand-600 (#ec4899) remains in use as FOREGROUND text on
                               white (3.53:1) and on brand-100 (3.84:1) surfaces. That is a
                               further AA failure, outside this checkpoint's owned paths, and is
                               reported for separate authorization rather than swept in.

                               This screen's visual acceptance status is UNCHANGED.

Defect corrected (global):     app/globals.css declared
                                 button, input, textarea, select { font: inherit; color: inherit; }
                               UNLAYERED. Unlayered CSS outranks every @layer rule, and
                               @import "tailwindcss" (Tailwind v4, layer order
                               theme, base, components, utilities) emits every utility into
                               @layer utilities. The reset therefore beat EVERY colour and
                               typography utility on EVERY button, input, textarea and select
                               in the application: the utility was generated and matched, then
                               silently lost the cascade, so the control rendered its
                               ancestor's colour and weight. Before the fix, every button in
                               the application computed to font-weight 400 — font-bold never
                               applied anywhere.
Fix applied:                   the same rule, moved INSIDE @layer base — the layer where
                               Tailwind's own preflight declares the identical normalization
                               (node_modules/tailwindcss/preflight.css). The reset was NOT
                               deleted: font/colour inheritance into form controls is a
                               deliberate normalization and is retained verbatim; only its
                               cascade position changed. @layer base { ... } appends to the
                               existing layer and does not redefine the layer order.
                               No token VALUE was changed. components/ui/button.tsx needed no
                               change — its primary pair was already correct in source and
                               simply could not reach the DOM.
Measured on this screen:       "Reset fixture" took text-small + font-bold; colour unchanged at 15.598:1.
                               No other control on this surface changed.
Excluded, deliberately:        components/brand/brand-mark.tsx (logotype — WCAG-exempt, R-B8)
                               and features/trainer/trainer-assessment.tsx:212 (decorative
                               fill, no text). Both verified untouched in the diff.
Browser viewport:              1440 x 1100 (measurement runs), 1440 x 1024 (diagnostic renders);
                               browser smoke suites at their own recorded viewports
Before screenshot:             not captured for this screen — this checkpoint proposes no visual
                               acceptance and changes no layout; contrast was measured
                               numerically in the rendered DOM instead, before and after
After screenshot:              diagnostic renders of the two named surfaces and four collateral
                               surfaces at 1440 x 1024, outside Git, at
                               UI_REFERENCE_FINAL_MVP/_checkpoint-evidence/F-01b/
Collateral sweep:              122 controls across 16 surfaces and all three portals, measured
                               before and after with the identical harness against production
                               builds: 23 unchanged, 99 changed, 0 added, 0 removed. ZERO
                               inputs, selects or textareas changed at all (.form-field sets
                               its own colour and remains authoritative). Six controls moved
                               below 4.5:1 and each was individually adjudicated: three are the
                               sr-only-labelled password-reveal SVG (SC 1.4.11, 3:1, met) and
                               three are DISABLED controls (SC 1.4.3 exempts inactive
                               components). No WCAG 2.2 AA regression.

                               controls (WCAG 2.2 AA)"
Acceptance status:             UNCHANGED — F-01b claims no screen visually accepted
Recorded, not fixed:           app/globals.css still declares *, body, h1-h4, :focus-visible,
                               ::selection, .card, .panel, .form-field and the loading
                               primitives UNLAYERED, so those also outrank Tailwind utilities —
                               most consequentially h1..h4 { color: #1b2b4b }, which would
                               defeat a text-white heading on a dark accent panel. This
                               checkpoint's owned path was the form-control reset ONLY, so the
                               remaining unlayered rules were deliberately left untouched and
                               are reported for separate authorization. The F-01a
                               text-brand-600 foreground failures (3.53:1 on white, 3.84:1 on
                               brand-100) are likewise unchanged and still open.

## GOVERNANCE CONFLICTS RECORDED - 2026-08-08 (Final MVP Phase A2, operator ruling Q-24)

**These are conflicts between the ratified Figma reference for this screen and B.E.S.T governance. Governance WINS. Do not build the reference behaviour described below.**

Source of record: `UI_REFERENCE_FINAL_MVP/FINAL_MVP_SCREEN_RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md` (GC register, declared authoritative by `FINAL_MVP_AUTHORITY_LOCK.md` section 28.2). The `reference/` tree is VISUAL rank 1 but FUNCTIONAL rank 5 (lowest) - it cannot override a functional, privacy or security rule.

- **GC-7 — Ratings shown in a "Level"/chips column although screen.md section 8 declares the screen "Not rating-bearing". GOVERNANCE WINS. DO NOT BUILD.**
- **GC-8 — Status chips "In session / Submitted / Draft". Only `submitted` is among the eight authorized report_status values (A-036). A status must never be added to encode UI presence. DO NOT BUILD the extra chips.**

**No authoritative visual bytes (PNG or HTML) were altered by this recording.**

## Artefact-read record — `P2-21`, 2026-08-16

Screen `09` was **rebuilt under the `AR-1b` rule**, so it gains a block and is
removed from `PRE_GATE`. That is the direction the rule's own header points:
*"It SHRINKS by one route only: a screen REBUILT under the rule gains a block …
so the forcing function points at removal, never at addition."*

⚠️ It was in `PRE_GATE` because its canonical route had already shipped — but
what it shipped was **`C2C-007`**: the route answered only `?status=needs_edit`
and returned `unavailable` otherwise. ▶ The exemption was recording a route that
existed, not a screen that had been built.

```artefact-read
