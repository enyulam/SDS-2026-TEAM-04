**Append-only.** Add a new entry at the bottom for every implementation checkpoint touching this screen. Never edit or delete an existing entry - a superseded entry is corrected by a later entry that says so.

**Rules.**

- Record a missing backend path or a missing governance decision as a **dependency**. Never invent it.
- Record a frame-versus-governance discrepancy. Never resolve it locally.
- Synthetic data only in any captured screenshot.
- One bounded screen checkpoint, or one tightly coupled shared-shell checkpoint, per commit.

## GOVERNANCE CONFLICTS RECORDED - 2026-08-08 (Final MVP Phase A2, operator ruling Q-24)

**These are conflicts between the ratified Figma reference for this screen and B.E.S.T governance. Governance WINS. Do not build the reference behaviour described below.**

Source of record: `UI_REFERENCE_FINAL_MVP/FINAL_MVP_SCREEN_RECONCILIATION_PLAN.md` (GC register, declared authoritative by `FINAL_MVP_AUTHORITY_LOCK.md` section 28.2). The `reference/` tree is VISUAL rank 1 but FUNCTIONAL rank 5 (lowest) - it cannot override a functional, privacy or security rule.

- **GC-6 — Per-dimension rating surfaces shown to MANAGEMENT. Prohibited by CLAUDE.md section 6 / A-038. DO NOT BUILD.**
- **GC-10 — The frame OMITS the "Management Insight" panel and the "Students Needing Follow-up" table, both mandated by CLAUDE.md section 6 with an EXACT DETERMINISTIC TEMPLATE. The frame is incomplete. The Insight panel must NEVER be AI-authored prose.**

**No authoritative visual bytes (PNG or HTML) were altered by this recording.**
